# MathEngine

A modern, modular C++20 mathematics library built for 2D and 3D game engine development.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Vector2D** and **Vector3D** operations
- **Matrix2x2**, **Matrix3x3**, **Matrix4x4** (coming soon)
- **Transforms** for 2D and 3D (position, rotation, scale)
- **Quaternions** for 3D rotation (future)
- **Math utilities** and constants (future)
- **Auto-generated documentation** with Doxygen and GitHub Pages
- Clean, modern C++20 codebase
- Full documentation for all structs and functions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Build Requirements
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.16+
- Doxygen (for documentation generation)

### Building (with CMake)

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## 📚 Documentation

Documentation is automatically generated with **Doxygen** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.  
You can view the live docs [here](https://Nathan-MRX.github.io/MathEngine/) (after setup).

To generate locally:
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```
