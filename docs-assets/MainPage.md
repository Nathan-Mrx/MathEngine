# 📘 Welcome to the MathEngine Documentation

---

MathEngine is a modular, modern C++20 mathematics library designed specifically for 2D and 3D game engine development.

This documentation is intended to help you understand, use, and extend the core math structures and utilities provided by MathEngine.

---

## 📚 What's Inside

- **Modules**: Organized groups of related math functionality (Vectors, Matrices, Transforms, Utilities).
- **Classes**: Detailed reference for each math structure (Vector2D, Matrix2x2, etc.).
- **Files**: List of header files where each module/class is declared.

Each class or module includes:
- Method descriptions
- Usage examples
- Mathematical background where necessary

---

## 🧭 Navigation Guide

- To browse available structures: check the **Classes** tab.
- To explore grouped functionality: check the **Modules** tab.
- To find specific headers: check the **Files** tab.
- Use the search bar to quickly find any function or concept.

## 🔮 Future Work

MathEngine will continue to expand with:
- 3D Transforms (Matrix3x3, Matrix4x4)
- Quaternion support
- Physics math utilities (collision, projections)
- Performance optimizations
